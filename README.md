# Gradient-Based-Attack-on-Uncertainty-Estimation-in-Deep-Neural-Networks

This project showcases examples of using the UCA algorithm and includes reproduction code for ACE. You can import specific datasets and models as needed. We will provide models for reproducing the results from our paper in subsequent updates.

## File Structure

- `UCA.ipynb`: Demonstrates examples of our algorithm usage and ACE reproduction code.
- `toolkit`: Contains some of the tools we implemented ourselves.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

2. Import datasets and models:
   - Place your datasets in the project root directory or a specified folder.
   - Import the required models as needed.

3. Open `UCA.ipynb` and run through the cells according to the comments to understand the usage examples of the UCA algorithm and the ACE code reproduction.

## Future Updates

We will provide complete models and detailed instructions for reproducing the results from our paper in future updates. Stay tuned.
